# Entertainment Web App

## Overview

This is a solution to the Entertainment Web App project. The app allows users to register, sign in, and explore movies and TV series. They can filter content based on their preferences, as well as add and remove bookmarked movies and TV series. The app uses modern web technologies to provide an engaging and responsive user experience.

### Features

- **User Registration and Sign In:** Users can register and sign in securely to access their personalized content.
- **Movie and TV Series Filter:** Users can filter movies and TV series based on various criteria (e.g., genre, release year).
- **Bookmarking:** Users can add movies and TV series to their bookmarks and remove them when needed.
- **Swiper Integration:** Used Swiper.js to create touch-friendly slideshows for movie and TV series content.
- **Responsive Design:** The app adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal experience on all devices.

## My Process

I structured the project by breaking it into components and pages to maintain organization and scalability. I used React Router for navigating between different pages and employed Tailwind CSS to build a modern, responsive design. TypeScript was used to enhance type safety and provide better developer experience. Swiper.js was integrated for smooth and user-friendly carousels to display movies and TV series. I also learned how to manage state using React Hooks and how to work with data more efficiently in this project.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- TypeScript
- React JS
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router
- Swiper.js

### What I learned

This project helped me improve my understanding of working with React hooks, managing application state, and handling data. I also learned how to structure a React project for better scalability and maintenance. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience with React Router for navigation, Tailwind CSS for rapid and responsive design, and Swiper.js for creating interactive slideshows.

I am excited to continue learning React and expand my knowledge of front-end development.

### Continued development

I plan to further enhance my skills in React and TypeScript, especially by working with advanced features like context providers, custom hooks, and working with more complex data structures. I also want to explore state management libraries such as Redux and improve my Swiper.js usage for more dynamic content presentations.
